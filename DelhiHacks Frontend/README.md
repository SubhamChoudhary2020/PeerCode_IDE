# **Are You Bored of Sharing Code on Chats 📱 and getting them back from friends 📟 after edit and still the code doesn't works**😕
......still this cycle goes endless 🌌

## *So thats Why i Built this Collaborative Coding IDE WebApp*
### *How is it Different...Well 🐒 nothing Unique but here is, what this project has to Offer.*

You have a Seperate **Canvas Board** where you can discuss your logic by noting them down to that canvas and other user in **RealTime** will also be able to see them. ( Thanks to the Socket.io Library 🌞 )
Video Calling Feature makes it easy to communicate and discussion is actually better in this.
You can share your Code Link and When other user Edits your code you will be able to see the code manipulation Live.
